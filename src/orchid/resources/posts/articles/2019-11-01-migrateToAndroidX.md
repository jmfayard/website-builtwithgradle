Hello Android devs,

I am looking for beta testers / early adopters for a new project I have been working on together with LouisCAD.

We want to provide a **reliable, simple, fun way to migrate an old Android project using the support libraries to AndroidX**.

## Why?

There are [hundred of thousands of projects that are still using "com.android.support:appcompat-v7" and friends](https://github.com/search?q=com.android.support%3Aappcompat-v7+filename%3Abuild.gradle&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) which are **not supported** anymore.

The Android team asked everyone to migrate to AndroidX instead, but in our opinion they have fucked up the migration story part of it. Which creates a big mess for app developers and library authors.

In theory, all you have to do is to use the menu entry:

   **Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX**

In practice, our experience was waiting minutes with an unresponsive IDE, then giving up with no other choice than force closing Android Studio, and finally getting a broken project, with some dangling fully qualified references (instead of proper import replacement). 


## What does it look like?

```bash
$ ./gradlew migrateToAndroidX

## Checking that you use compileSdkVersion 28
âœ” ðŸ†— You are using compileSdkVersion 28

## Migrating classes from support libraries to AndroidX.
âœ” ðŸ†— Parsing file androidx-class-mapping.csv
âœ” ðŸ†— Modules: [Application]
âœ” ðŸ†— Found 18 source files that may need migration
âœ” ðŸ†— File androidx-class-mapping.csv parsed correctly
âœ” ðŸ†— Starting batch migration...
Migrating file "CameraActivity.java" â€¦ overwriting fileâ€¦  Done. âœ”ðŸ†—
Migrating file "Camera2BasicFragment.java" â€¦ overwriting fileâ€¦  Done. âœ”ðŸ†—
Migrating file "build.gradle" â€¦
âœ” ðŸ†— 2 source files (kt,java,xml) have been migrated (16 didn't need it).
âœ” ðŸ†— 0 gradle files have been migrated (1 didn't need it).

## Detecting Gradle properties
âœ” ðŸ†— gradle.properties already contains [android.useAndroidX, android.enableJetifier]

## Your turn: add the AndroidX libraries to app/build.gradle

// app/build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation(AndroidX.legacy.supportV4)
    implementation(AndroidX.legacy.supportV13)
    implementation(AndroidX.cardView)
    implementation(AndroidX.appCompat)
}
```

## I am in! What do you need?

To make the project **reliable**, we need people willing to beta test it once we make it available. 

You may have a project that needs to be migrated, or that you have migrated already but you can find the commit before in the commit history.
